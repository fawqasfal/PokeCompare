PokeCompare
===========
Ancient site I made when I was like, 14. Keeping it here because, honestly, it's just cute. Even if the code is ugly, it brings back memories. Back when there were only 5 generations...

This CGI script that lets you compare different Pokemon.  
Make sure you're on Python 2.7. This will not work on 3+. If you have the Python manager Anaconda, you can run :

conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda
source activate py27 

And then python2 will run Python 2.7. 


If you don't have Anaconda, you can download it (if you have Homebrew) using : brew install Caskroom/cask/anaconda



run : 

python2 -m CGIHTTPServer 8000
Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000/pokestylev2.html
