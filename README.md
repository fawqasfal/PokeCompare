PokeCompare
===========
Found this from about 2 years ago, was for an intro class. Shitty Python CGI script that lets you compare different Pokemon, It's humbling just how awful this really is, both on a product/code level. Using technology that was made obsolete in the late 90s with non-modular completely ugly and inefficient code that proves you can make Python look like Perl with all the brevity and expressiveness of Java. I'm just happy I improved.
